# smartlane-opcua-js-wrapper

The component included in this factsheet is a wrapper whose task is to collect events produced by an OPC-UA server (for example on an IoT device in the shopfloor) and dispatch them using the AMQP protocol to the subscribed listeners (through the BEinCPPS Smart Lane and OpenIoT Middleware). 

The wrapper provides two Node.js components to receive data via an OPC-UA TCP binding and transmit them using the AMQP protocol via the Smart Lane to the OpenIoT Middleware (i.e. RabbitMQ Broker Server).
